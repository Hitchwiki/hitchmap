      Hitchmap is <i>open data</i>, licensed under the Open Data Commons Open
      Database License (ODbL).
    </p>
    <p>
      You are free to copy, distribute, transmit and adapt our data, as long as
      you credit Hitchmap and its contributors. If you alter or build upon our
      data, you may distribute the result only under the same licence.
    </p>

    <h3>How to credit Hitchmap</h3>
    <p>
      Where you use Hitchmap data, you are required to do the following two
      things:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide credit to Hitchmap by displaying our copyright notice.</li>
      <li>
        Make clear that the data is available under the Open Database License.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For the copyright notice, we have different requirements on how this
      should be displayed, depending on how you are using our data. For example,
      different rules apply on how to show the copyright notice depending on
      whether you have created a browsable map, a printed map or a static image.
      This the key part from the ODBL license:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>[I]f you Publicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice
        associated with the Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any
        Person that uses, views, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise
        exposed to the Produced Work aware that Content was obtained from the
        Database, Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective
        Database, and that it is available under this License.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      In plain English: anyone who sees our data must know the data is ours. If
      you display the data on a map, you should put a copyright notice on top of
      that map. Putting the attribution behind an information icon or a menu
      does <b>not</b> constitute sufficient attribution.
    </p>

    <h3>Copyright Infringement</h3>
    <p>
      Hitchmap contributors are reminded never to add data from any copyrighted
      sources without explicit permission from the copyright holders.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you believe that copyrighted material has been inappropriately added to
      the Hitchmap database, please contact us directly through our website.
