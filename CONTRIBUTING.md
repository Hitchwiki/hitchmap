# Contributing

Contributions are greatly appreciated and we are happy to help you get started with your first feature or bug fix.

File an [issue](https://github.com/Hitchwiki/hitchmap/issues) if you have a feature request or found a bug.

Perform a [pull request](https://github.com/Hitchwiki/hitchmap/pulls) from your [fork](https://github.com/Hitchwiki/hitchmap/fork) of the repository if you solved an issue. (It's best to file an issue first so we can discuss it and reference it in the PR.)

## Linting

We use Ruff for linting [https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/). The settings can be found in `ruff.toml`.

To configure automatic linting for VS Code check out the extension [https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode).
