He's one of the many drivers avoiding the nearby highway. He dropped me near Vila Velha de Rodao where the road to Coimbra begins northwards. It was hard to leave that mentioned place, as no car enters the highway to Lisbon. So if you're here in Castelo Branco, make sure your driver doesn't take you to a village.

The lady in the shop seemed to have met hitchhikers here before, as she approached us with chairs, question in google translate "do you want to travel with no payment?", and also offered us a cardboard to make a sign. Just because it's right after the turn from Skun it makes it more difficult for cars that are going from Phnom Penh direction to stop. Anyway, you can chill there, get some cold drink, and wait for your ride to Siem Reap. ―otv3n, January 2024</td>

      <td>Perfect spot. You will find a huge mostly empty gas station with a lot of space for cars to stop and you will be visible to drivers. In the morning hours the traffic was low, almost no motorbikes at all, so it's easier for cars to stop here. As most cars pass slowly here, you can even hitch a truck. We got a direct truck ride to Huế in about 5 minutes.To get to this spot from the city, you must get bus number 06 (Vinh – Hà Tĩnh). It starts from Chợ ga Vinh (near the train station, google it), and passes through the city so that you might catch it in a different place, we got it around the Bến Thuỷ area. It goes all the way to Hà Tĩnh, but I suggest you get off at this intersection or directly at the gas station, otherwise, that would be difficult to get away from Hà Tĩnh.―otv3n, November 2023</td>

This doesn't work if you, like me, look Middle Eastern so the truck drivers will ignore you thinking you're irregular.

Google Translate works pretty well now compared to 8 years ago. I found that showing a digital map to drivers is always confusing for them, so I prepared a simple hand-drawn map with a few nearest towns on the way. Showing this map to the driver works perfectly in combination with the phrase "Bạn đi đâu (Where are you going)?". Also "miễn phí (free)" is pretty helpful to let drivers know you are willing to get a free ride.―otv3n, November 2023</td>

      <td>The free bus to maxima isn't running anymore, I just took a regular bus to "Gariunai" station for 0,90€ and walked the rest of the way (which is a great option, there is a footpath next to the highway and you don't have to cross it, so it's really safe this way!). When I reached it I got a lift to Kaunas after just 5 minutes, so this is a really good spot, even though the cars are driving quite fast and there are already multiple lanes. But the cars can easily see you, and there is enough space to stop at the whole exit lane without bringing anyone in danger. If nothing else works you can always just ask the drivers that are doing a break here anyway. I can recommend this spot! ―Anonymous, November 2023</td>

The best way to HH is to have a sing with ***Pirot*** or ***Dimitrovdgra***HH to the border can be difficult!!! Because people is afraid about immigrants!! So, better if you look White person hahahaha I am from Colombia and I look very árabe sometimes, but still I am lucky.The best advice is to HH from the entrance of the gas station, because also you can catch the cars who is passing on the highway, because if you stay inside the gas station! * without traffic* you can be there for hours !!! To arrive to this gas station you can take the bus Number 4 Ang get out 2 bus stops before the end. And then walk in the highway for 15 minutes and that is ! You will see, use Google maps ! Or just walk from the center if you are too backpacker. Remember that HH IS ABOUT LUCK!!!! ―Anonymous, October 2023</td>
